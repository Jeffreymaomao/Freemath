## Modifications

We have modified the MathQuill code. The modifications include changes to the `moveUpDown` function to add custom focus handling. Specifically, the following line was added:

```js
function moveUpDown(self, dir) {
    ...
    if (typeof prop === 'function'){
        prop = ancestor[dirOutOf](cursor);
        window.needFocusUpDown = true; // this means the focus should jump to next/previous equation (by mao)
    }
    ...
}
```
